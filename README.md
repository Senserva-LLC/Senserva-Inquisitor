*Know your Entra ID Security State in minutes!*

Quick Note, we have a ton of feedback, so much so we took the process of line and we coming out with new, broader release.  Targeting this summer. Thanks! - Mark

Welcome! This may be the biggest security tool find of 2025. Use the [Senserva](https://senserva.com) $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ to just look for top issues or drill deep on the state of each Entra ID you manage, the data and interface support both.  $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ compliments the Senserva Drift management product.

# $${\color{LimeGreen}The} {\color{LimeGreen}Senserva} {\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$
This is **Beta 1** of the Senserva Inquisitor, built to be used by both IT and Security teams, to do quick or depth security reviews.  Inquisitor is a command line that popups up the browser to display HTML results. Results are also output in json files and a SQLite database to provide choices. This release is for Windows, the Linux/Container version coming in a not too distant release.

# ⚡️ $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Just Run It

Download $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ to get started, with a double click or a clone, and enter inq.exe. $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ has a digital signature so your AV should be OK with it. If not please let us know right away.  We do not currently support any Github zip file or release downloads so direct downloads and clones are supported. Just click on the Inq.exe and find the download button or clone the repository.

You do not have to register, log in or do anything other than review, agree to and follow our [EULA](https://github.com/Senserva-LLC/Senserva-Inquisitor/blob/main/EULA.html). Delete the installation directory and $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ is gone, it only uses the installation directory. You may be asked to use the Demo Senserva Entra ID Application, if you use it to see if you like Inq.exe be sure to delete it after its first usage and make your own version, then secure it so you control who has access to it.  We provide the Demo just to make it easy to do initial evaluations of Beta 1, you should create and secure your own Entra ID App. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To do an audit enable either ***Global Reader*** or ***Security Reader***.  We strongly suggest using PIM and setting a short window on these rights.
>  
> The INQ.EXE has been digitally signed by Senserva, and co-signed by Microsoft. In spite of this, some anti-virus software may flag it for attention and quarentine the app, both at download and possibly later at runtime. Consult your AV software documentation for instructions on how to green-flag the app. TIP - When looking at the app in the Windows file manager, the correct app will have a green Senserva 'S' as a logo. A placeholder file generated by AV software will not.  Check [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6553310709ad3f46a22ed3a7b62dfc299a8e836be9e5bf9ea2c8d13b0efad649/detection). Not sure why Zillya is reporting an issue, none of the other are.  Please run VirusTotal on your own if you wish.

> # $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ Use Cases
  * Quick security checks, just look for high level issues.
  * Senserva cleans the data from Microsoft Graph, and the ARM API so you do not have to. Nice clean Json.
  * Recurring deep review, dig into the data to look for trends. Replaces need to call APIs or KQL by hand.
  * Monitor configuration drift across a wide varity of security products (Future)
  * Conditional Access Rules and Usage - dig deep in to CA, see what rules are used, not used, will never be used and more
  * Replace existing scripts and grab data from the Inquisitor SQL database or generated CSV files
  * Inquisitor can be run over and over, it only records changes so it is very efficent

> # Why We Created $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$
> 
>  -  Mark [Shavlik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavlik_Technologies), CEO of Senserva, here, $${\color{LimeGreen}The} {\color{LimeGreen}Senserva} {\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ is designed to be a free IT auditor and manager, with remediation, for physical, virtual and Cloud systems built over time. Its goal is to be usable by any level of user, by IT or Security teams, the more advanced the user the more benefits this product provides. Its first installment is focused on Azure Entra ID. We are creating $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ with the goal of building a team of industry leaders to work with us, currently the source code is restricted to that group until it is ready for broader release or it may remain private to this group.  Please let us know if you want to join the group.  As background I have written widely used security free scanners including [HFNetChk](https://www.itprotoday.com/devops/hfnetchk-microsoft-s-new-hotfix-tool) and [MBSA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2012/10/22/microsoft-free-security-tools-microsoft-baseline-security-analyzer/) (working with Microsoft). Both help secure millions of computers. $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ compliments Senserva's proprietary Drift automation product. Thanks! - Mark


# 🚀 Key $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Features
* There are no servers used. No web servers, no database severs. None.  Yet there is a full relational database thanks to SQLite and rich web pages based on html files local to the inq.exe directly to review results. This is done by design, to keep the data local and to keep it simple on the outside but very advance do the inside.
* Just download the Signed Inq.exe and go, setup is complete automated. 
* Each time you run an scan only changes are recorded in the database.  You can run inq.exe all you want and only new data is saved.
* Easy to login to Azure, including Zero setup options.
* It is easy to share data with others. Inq.exe runs in two modes, audit mode which requires an Azure Login and Reporting mode which can be run by anyone.
* Built to be customized. The database and user interface can be easily accessed and customized from multiple platforms to create custom monitors and reports.
* The User interface can export Json with user interface search and filter dials that enable it to be broad or specific data. 
* Output text can be easily customized via auto-generated CSV files that are used to display all key text.
* Full leveled logging to auto-rolling files support, makes it easy to understand what is going on inside Inq.exe.
* Trends stored in the data. $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ data is deduped and contains a history.  So, it does not grow too large, but at the same time you can observe changes over time.
* Source code available to select partners, friends of course family.
  
# 🌟 What $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Manages in this Release
Please note the data is a bit chatty in this release, it is broad data to show what is available. We are adding a rules engine to make the data more focused on actions to take, and we are also looking for feedback in this area.  This is Beta 1, while very functional this release is also looking for feedback.

# 🛠️ How $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Works

> [!TIP]
> Start with the quick start and take the defaults.  Let $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ do the initial heavy lifting. Then after a few usages start looking deep into the data. The $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ data is tagged with levels such as High Risk, or just Informational. You can filter the data in the UI to quickly learn your state.  You need to have the Entra ID role Security Reader or Global Reader work best.

$${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ runs scans on demand, with scheduling and Containers coming in a future beta.

## Getting Credentials

$${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ uses [Web Account Manager (WAM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scenario-desktop-acquire-token-wam) and [The Azure Identity Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-dotnet). 

### Defaults to -- auto
If no parameters are used the default is --auto, a mode that selects the best login for you.

#### Commandline Parameters

> [!TIP]
> If you are using Azure CLI login with that to start out.  It is easy, you have nothing to do. Over time you may want to create your own Entra ID Client to get all the rights $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ is able to take advanage of.

## How $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ uses User Rights.

#### The Senserva Demo Entra ID Application

Scope = ["UserAuthenticationMethod.Read", "IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All", "IdentityRiskyServicePrincipal.Read.All", "IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All", "AuditLog.Read.All", "Policy.Read.All", "User.Read.All", "Directory.Read.All", "Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess"];

#### The Azure CLI

Scope = ["AuditLog.Read.All", "Directory.AccessAsUser.All", "Group.Read.All", "User.Read.All"];

The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) connects to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. It caches credentials and $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ reads taht cache to log you in if you requst it. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli)

#### The Az PowerShell Module

Note Beta 1 is not reliable for this, at  least in our testing. It may work for you as we believe we are calling everything correctly.

Scope =  ["AuditLog.Read.All", "Directory.AccessAsUser.All"];

The Az PowerShell module is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from PowerShell. [The Az PowerShell Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-13.0.0)

#### Customer Entra ID Client

Based this Senserva's but make your own, using the rights you wish to use. Be sure to secure it so you control who runs it.  $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ will only scan for the items can access so include the roles you want to include.  Note you may be surprised at what you can see.

## $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ In Action

## Logging

$${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ has detailed logging, stored in the Log subdirectory.  The scan $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ will show select data so you can easily monitor progress, but all the data on the the UI and much more will be in the logs.  

Logs/SenservaLogFile20250116 is an example log name.  The numbers break out to the year and the day, and the logs have automatic roll over so they stay managable.

A quick review of the logs gives you an indepth review of what $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ is doing, or the issues may have.

## Working with the Results

There are multiple ways to work with the results from $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$

* Using our advance UI to work with the data, sort it, filter and export it
* Export the data to CSV and us Microsoft Excel to work with the data
* Export Json from the UI and create you own views with your viewing tools
* Directly access the database with your own application, possibly in Python

By default CSV files create are Audit.csv (Clean, reviewed), Nodes.csv (Raw Azure data), Edges.csv (connections between Azure data), ConditionalAccessCounts.csv (usage counts), and SigninCounts.csv (extensive log reviews). Users can create their own custom CSV files via the html file based user interface. This data is the same data that is in the database, it is just presented this way so it can be viewed in things like Microsoft Excel.

# $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Database

The Senserva $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ uses a relational database to store results. You can 100% ignore the database if you wish, or you can dig in an create your own reporting.  The data model is basic and after a few runs of Inq.exe it will make sense to you.

> [!NOTE]
> Digging into the Senserva $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ database is for advanced users who want to create their own front-end to the data, something we encourage as long as license rights are followed.  But - at the same time - we have a great customizable UI out of the box, start there.  You can edit the text via published CSV files if you wish.

## ⚙️ $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Integrations

$${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ is built with SQLite. SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. [More About Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

It is easy to work with SQLite in Python and other languages. The Python SQLite3 module is used to integrate the SQLite database with Python. There is no need to install this module separately as it comes along with Python after the 2.5x version. [More About Python and Sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) 

SQLite can also be used with PowerShell to read Inq.Uisitor data.  [SQLite and PowerShell with SimplySql](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SimplySql/2.0.2.70)

# Easily Extend $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$

Many csv files are generated by $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$, as are ready to change the text of what is generated, making Excel a great way to extend $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$.  The same is true for Json, the $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ database has a variety of json, both detailed as it comes back from Azure, or cleanuped up and enhanced json as is reported by $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$.

## $${\color{LimeGreen}Inquisitor}$$ Database Design

This is an quick overview of the main data tables used by Senserva to go give you an idea of the extent of our data.  Use a product like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to full review the data format and content.  Or contact us we are glad to help.  Our data model is simple and the data is rich, take a peek behind the scenes with the DB Browsers when you get a minute.

You do not need to know the database to run $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$.  These notes are for people who want to create their own customizations. Our tables also contain rich set of Json data as well so is a lot of data you can use to create custom solutions.  Or you can just use our UI, it is pretty good :)

# Changing Content with the $${\color{LimeGreen}Inq.exe}$$ CSV file

Senserva provides an Excel Compliant file that you can easily edit to control output text.  The file is created after the first run of Inq.exe (the first run includes the install phase). So to use this CSV data just run 2 scans, the 2nd one is fast because we only look for changes since the last scan.
